          Hola! I am Rohit — an AI/ML Engineer by profession and a UI Developer
          by passion.
        </p>
        <p>
          I build intuitive interfaces, working on everything from AI platforms
          and computer vision pipelines to full-stack web apps. Alongside my
          professional work, I also take on freelance projects, helping bring
          ideas to life with clean, scalable, and creative solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Out of work, I energize by watching FC Barcelona and listening to
          Martin Garrix, and I&apos;m always ready to build something
          extraordinary together.
        </p>
        <p>Let&apos;s create something great together. Visca el Barça!</p>
